I am a Professor of Research Software Engineering with a proven track-record of forming inter-disciplinary collaborations to achieve agenda-driven research, through the provision of software engineering solutions. My experience is within the intersection of [Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) computing](./gpus/), [complex systems simulation](./complex-systems/) and [research software engineering leadership](./rse/). I hold an academic position but consider myself first and foremost a research software engineer, predominantly motivated by facilitation of research through novel software engineering approaches. I have led the development and application of the [FLAME GPU](htp://www.flamegpu.com) software to a wide range of research and industrial challenges and have led development teams in the application of GPUs to accelerate computational simulations. I also have a track record of building and developing teams of research software engineers, enacting institutional change and developing robust financial and operational models for technical teams supporting research. I have a five-year total award value of Â£4.3M in research funding as a PI or CI and have published over 60 peer reviewed journal and conference papers. I have led projects with high levels of industrial impact attracting industrial research funding and consultancy from partners such as Fujitsu Research Europe, SIEMENS, Network Rail, Atkins, and the Department for Transport.

# Collaborative Interests and Consultancy
------

I regularly collaborate on research and industrially funding research projects (including consultancy) on the application of the FLAME GPU software or optimisation of code (using GPUs) to a range of areas. E.g. Computational Biology, Pedestrian Dynamics and Transport Simulation. 

# Career Highlights
------
 - Delivery of world leading GPU software (FLAME GPU) to facilitate the use of GPU system to simulate complex systems.
 - Established the Research Software Engineering Group at the University of Sheffield growing this organically using an innovative cost recovery model.
 - Establishing the Research Software Engineering team within the Institute of Computing for Climate Science (ICCS), leading in recruitment and establishing the working practice and delivery model.
 - Established collaborations and consultancy with industry partners including SIEMENS, ATKINS, Fujitsu Research Europe, the Rail Standards and Safety Board and the Department for Transport to demonstrate impact of GPU computing.
 - A selection of high-quality journal and conference papers spanning a range of disciplines and highlighting the breadth of my academic collaborations. e.g. European Radiology Experimental, Journal of Flood Risk Management, Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing, Transactions on Computational Science, Concurrency and Computation
 - Development and delivery of a new teaching module on GPU computing, a strategically import area for the department. Completion of Higher Education training and fellowship within the Higher Education Authority.
 - Established national partnerships as an investigator on Tier 2 HPC facilities JADE and JADE2 providing leading capability to university researchers in the areas of machine learning and AI.
 - Establishing partnerships with NVIDIA, acceptance to the NVIDIA Applied Research Accelerator Program, previous CUDA research and teaching centre, running of collaborative GPU hackathon events, facilitation and delivery of training in GPU compute and AI.
 - Elected as President of the Society for RSE, established links with research funders, the Software Sustainability Institute and Industry partners. Currently a member of the RSE Society Advisory Board
